-------------------
CREATING OUR FIRST NUXT APP
-------------------
USING create-nuxt-app CLI: 
    - It has a github page  
    - Can install via npm 
    1) npm install -g create-nuxt-app 
    2) Navigate to appropriate project directory 
    3) create-nuxt-app <nameOfApp> 
    4) Go through prompts (NONE OF THESE ARE REQUIRED - you just have the option)
        - You can choose server frameworks (for integrations)
        - We will get to this later (for now choose 'none')
        - Choose either 'Universal' or 'SPA' 
            - Universal is for SSR apps 
        - You can also preinstall axios for HTTP requests 
        - Also given an option to enable linter and prettier

        - The filenames themselves are important too 
    - The files here are single-file Vue components

WHAT CAN WE BUILD WITH NUXT
-------------------
1) Universal apps  
    - First view is dynamically rendered on the server 
    - After first load, Application turns into a SPA 
        - This is great for SEO         
2) Single Page App 
    - App starts after first load 
    - App stays SPA 
        - Nuxt just simplifies the Vue development 
3) Static App 
    - You can pre-render all views 
        - You generate a static page 
    - After first load, Application turns into a SPA
    - Downside is that you have to rerender after you update the app features. 
        - Also great for SEO
