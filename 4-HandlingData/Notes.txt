MODULE INTRODUCTION 
-------------------
- Time to add dynamic data!

GOALS: 
    - Add data to the JavaScript on the Server-Side 
    - This won't be data from database or API yet however 
    - We will set it up as if it were coming from a backend
    - We will look at how Vuex connects to this 
    - Start to explore Server-side rendering 


-------------------
ADDING DYNAMIC DATA 
-------------------
- GOAL: 
    - Extract data outside of the component level objects 
    - All data should be supplied by the page(s) that the component 
      is being used on. 


-------------------
PREPARING DATA ON THE SERVER-SIDE (through Nuxt)
-------------------
- Nuxt is NOT a server-side framework which can connect 
  to a database perse. 
    - However, it has ways to call certain scripts on the 
      client's server. 

PROBLEM: 
- In a normal Vue app you would fetch data in the 
  created() lifecycle hook.
    - Most likely you would reach out directly to a backend 
      server/API. 
    - This operation happens and loads on the client because 
      the client has to wait for the created hook to return 
      data asynchronously 
    - Any web crawler would miss out on all of this data. 
    - This is BAD FOR SEO ***** 

NUXT SOLUTION: asyncData(context, callback) 
- Nuxt provides a special method for loading async data 
  to 'page-level' components ONLY. 

- Nuxt will execute this method on the server *****
    - Nuxt will wait for the process in async data to finish 
    - This ensures that the client gets a fully rendered page 
      since the data has finished being fetched BEFORE mounting
    - Since this data is fetched BEFORE CREATED it will NOT 
      HAVE ACCESS TO 'this' keyword. 
        - 'this' will NOT reference the Vue instance as normal.

- It has a similar function signature as the normal data() 
      method provided by Vue instances. 
    - It has to ultimately return an object
    - To get access to the returned object (<returnValue>)
        1) Return a promise and resolve it with the <returnValue>
        2) call the "callback" parameter and pass the return 
           value to it. (Deprecated)
            - Similar to done() in mocha, this callback lets 
              Nuxt know the method is done 
            - EXAMPLE: 
                callback(null, <returnValue>)
        3) Use async/await 
            - EXAMPLE: 
                async asyncData(context) {
                    let { data } = await axios.get(`https://my-api/posts/${params.id}`)
                    return { title: data.title }
                }
    - Once the process is triggered as complete: 
        - The <returnValue> is usable in the template. 


-------------------
ASSIGNMENT 2: SERVER-SIDE DATA 
-------------------
- Finished this 
- Was basically a practice run for async data method 


-------------------
ASYNC DATA ON CLIENT & SERVER 
-------------------
- With our current set up, no server-side rendering is being 
  performed AFTER the first page load. 
    - If the first page has been loaded already we are in 
      SPA mode. 

- TESTING SERVER SIDE EXECUTION: 
    - If you put console.log statements you can see 
      that depending on which console logs the message. 
    - IF SERVER EXECUTION: 
        - you will see --> NODE CONSOLE MESSAGE. 
    - IF CLIENT EXECUTION:
        - you will see --> BROWSER CONSOLE MESSAGE. 

***** KEY TAKEAWAY ***** 
- Async data is something we ALWAYS wait for BUT: 
    - It does not always run on the server. 


-------------------
A CLOSER LOOK AT THE CONTEXT OBJECT 
-------------------
- The context object has a lot of uses
- It is passed as the first parameter to asyncData(context)

WHAT IT CONTAINS:
    - isServer, isClient
        - This is deprecated in latest version use 
          process.client instead 
    - isStatic 
    - isDev (development mode or not)
    - env (environment variables)
    - store (vuex store)
    - redirect() 
        - Function which allows us to redirect 
    - ALSO CONTAINS ROUTER/ROUTE PROPERTIES
        - route 
            - Contains all of the route properties 
        - params (alias for route.params)
            - Very useful since we don't get access to the 
            this.$route variable inside of asyncData.
        


-------------------
ADDING ASYNC DATA TO A SINGLE POST 
-------------------
- Added a Promise based use of asyncData to posts/id page. 
    - All you have to do is call .then() and .catch right inside 
    - If it resolves the data will be loaded 
    - Otherwise if an error occurs just put a .catch handler and call 
      context.error(new Error())
        - By doing this Nuxt will automatically redirect us to the error.vue layout 
          if there is an error. 



-------------------
USING PROMISES IN ASYNCDATA 
-------------------
- To use promises you have to NOT pass the callback as the second param 
  to asyncData.
- To test errors just call reject() 


-------------------
ADDING THE VUEX STORE 
-------------------
- Every time we navigate around we have to wait for the asyncData 
  calls to finish for the pages to load. 
- Sometimes you want to fetch data and load it into the Vuex Store to 
  shorten loading times or make it available to other components 

- ADDING VUEX: 
    1) Installing: The package already comes installed with NuxtJS 
    2a) Classic Mode Approach: 
        - Create a index.js file in ~/store 
        - One store and module for the app 
        - Define mutations, actions and getters in index.js 
    2b) Modules Mode Approach: 
        - Create multiple .js files in ~/store 
        - Every .js file becomes a namespaced module  
            - Essentially you can slice your store up into multiple smaller modules 
    3) Create a function in the ~/store/index.js file 
        - This function will be responsible for returning 
          a new Vuex.Store() instance. 
        - We take this approach because we want the function 
          to be callable by Nuxt 
            - If we returned an object instead of this function 
              all users would get the same instance of the store. 
            - This is because Nuxt runs the store on the 
              server-side. 
        - All you have to do is set up the Vuex Store as normal 
          and return it as an instance. 
    4) Export the function that returns a new store as the 
       default export. 
        - Nuxt will take it from here and inject the store into 
          all of the project components 


-------------------
VUEX, fetch(), AND nuxtServerInit() 
-------------------
- Instead of calling an action in a component to set 
  data to the store, and calling asyncData(), what other options are 
  there? 

FETCH METHOD: 
    - Special method added by Nuxt
    - Its API is similar to asyncData
        - It gets the same context object as an argument 
        - It runs on the server the first time 
        - You have to return a Promise 
    - Differences: 
        - Don't return the data in the .then() case 
            - Instead you should store the data in the $store 
            - You can commit a mutation at this point. 
            - Because it doesn't return data you can't reference 
              any return value in the template as you would with 
              asyncData()
    - What it's good for: 
        - You don't want to load data into the component directly 
        - You want to prepopulate the store.  
    - Downsides: 
        - When you have already went to the page it will try and 
          re-fetch the same data . 
        - Therefore you should implement a condition that checks 
          if the data has already been fetched. 
            - This would be implemented in the component's fetch 
              method directly. 
            EXAMPLE: 
              if (context.store.state.thingThatsLoaded) {
                  return null;
              } else { // normal fetch logic }

LOADING DATA ON THE SERVER: 
    PROBLEM: 
        - How can you control when to trigger a fetch call? 
            EXAMPLE: 
            - Upon first page load the data needs to be fetched 
            - But subsequent visits to the page shouldn't re-fetch 
            data necessarily. 
    SOLUTION: nustServerInit()
        - Special method to execute logic on the server-side 
            - This method can be used to initialize the store 
              with data. 
            - The method will automatically run on the server ONE TIME ONLY!
        - This is an action provided by Nuxt
        - API: 
            - nuxtServerInit(vuexContext, context)
            - vuexContext: the normal context object from Vuex 
                - Has commit() method 
            - context: this is the same context object that 
              asyncData gets from Nuxt 
                - Contains information about the environment
                - Has the router on it too. 
                - etc. 

WRAP UP: 
  - Basically you can load data in different ways. 
    - You can use any one of these methods or mix and match as needed.
  1) Load data asynchronously within a page component: asyncData()
    - Only need data on a specific page 
  2) Load it into the store via component: fetch()
    - If you need data in more than one page 
      -> put it in the store after fetched  
  3) Initialize data into the store: nuxtServerInit()
    - If you need application-wide data
