MODULE INTRODUCTION 
-------------------
- NUXT allows us to configure our routing very easy 
- Spares you from writing your own route config 

-------------------
FROM FOLDERS TO ROUTES 
-------------------
- You can create the same structure as the route config without writing an 
  actual config file. 

APPROACH: 
- Create top level URLs by naming the .vue file what you want 
    EXAMPLE: pages/users.vue --> '/users' 
- Create pages/index.vue file --> Starting component for '/' route
- Create subfolders for other routes 
    - pages/products/index.vue
    - pages/products/_id/index.vue 


-------------------
CREATING A ROUTE WITH A DYNAMIC PATH 
-------------------
- How do we create a route with a dynamic path? 

FILE NAME APPROACH: 
- Use "_" character as a prefix 
    EXAMPLE: pages/_id.vue --> '/1', '/2', etc 
    EXAMPLE 2: pages/users/_id.vue --> '/users/1', '/users/2', etc. 
- With the File name approach: 
    - Neighboring files won't need to provide the parameter 
- With the nested folder approach:
    - The dynamic param is ALWAYS required in the URL path.

ACCESSING ROUTE PARAMS:
- All of the regular route data is injected automatically into the component 
  from VueJS. 
- Behind the scenes Nuxt is using vue-router as normal. Its just creating 
  the config for you. 
    - Therefore, in the component template you can access $route.params as normal 



-------------------
ADDING LINKS AND NAVIGATING AROUND 
-------------------
- You can add normal anchor tags on the components but this
  will cause a page reload. 
- Instead you should use vue-router links. 
    - <router-link to=""></router-link>
- Can also use nuxt-links 
    - Nuxt links come with transition animations 
    - <nuxt-link to=""></nuxt-link>
- Can navigate programmatically the same as you do 
  in regular Vue.
    - Use this.$router.push('<relativeURL>');


-------------------
ASSIGNMENT 1: PAGES AND ROUTING 
-------------------
1) Create two routes:
    /products and /products/:pid 
2) Add a button to the main page. The button should 
   navigate programmatically to /products 
3) Add two links to the /products page. 
    - Links should go to /products/1 and /products/2
4) Output the product id in on the /products/:pid page


-------------------
VALIDATING PARAMETERS 
-------------------
NUXT PAGE COMPONENTS: 
- Page components get special properties in the Vue instance.
    - This is in addition to the default Vue instance properties 
- One additional property: 'validate' 
    - Nuxt gives you access to this which allows you to 
    build-in URL parameter validation 

VueInstance.validate({params, store, query}):
    - Params on the object passed has the route params 
    - This function should return true upon successful 
      validation and false when failing. 
    - If validate returns false the route will not load. 


-------------------
CREATING NESTED ROUTES 
-------------------
- Load content from one page into another (like partials)

HOW TO DO THIS:
- Create a route in pages/
    EXAMPLE: pages/nested.vue
- Create a folder in pages/ with the same name as the route 
    - This folder will be treated as the "child folder"
        - Any components in here will be accessible to 
        the main route via the nuxt-child tag 
    EXAMPLE: 
        pages/nested.vue 
        pages/nested/index.vue
- Use nuxt-child tag in the main route (similar to router-view)
    - Like router-view this can take a name or not 
    - If you DONT use a name it will load the index.vue 
    of the child folder by default. 
- In the child index you can then load in other children 
  dynamically by using the same pattern just deeper in the 
  directory tree. 
    EXAMPLE: 
        pages/nested.vue 
        pages/nested/index.vue
        pages/nested/another.vue 
        pages/nested/another/index.vue 
        
        URL: /nested 
        - This will load nested which loads its child index 

        URL: /nested/another 
        - This will load nested 
        - Nested will ignore its own index.vue and 
          load in another.vue 
        - Another (needs nuxt-child tag) loads its child index
