MODULE INTRODUCTION
-------------------
- Sometimes you want to add functionality to the default 
  Nuxt framework. 
- You can change a lot of the behavior through the config 
  file. 
- You can add behavior through plugins. 


-------------------
THE NUXT CONFIG FILE -> nuxt.config.js  
-------------------
- Settings play a role in: 
    - Content of the page 
    - Build settings 
    - Optimizations 
    - etc. 

- The default file comes with some settings 
    - But there are plenty more on the Nuxt website/API reference. 

SETTINGS: 
    - mode:  
        - 'universal' -> Take advantage of Nuxt SSR
        - 'spa' -> No SSR 
    - head: {}
        - Whatever goes into this object is added to every single page's <head> in HTML. 
        - If you want to add specific head tags to a particular   page, you can do so just: 
            1) add the "head" property to the page.vue where 
            you want the special tags. 
            2) this would be just another Nuxt property which 
            is automatically injected into the Vue instance of 
            PAGES ONLY. 
    


-------------------
MANIPULATING ROUTING SETTINGS  
-------------------
config.generate 
- Property that changes the way Nuxt statically generates pages 
- Have to work with this when deploying 

config.rootDir
- Property that is used to set the root directory of the project
- All your Nuxt files as well as node_modules have to be contained within 
  this directory for it to work. 
- default is '/' 

config.router 
- allows you to override some settings of the Nuxt router 
- You can set ANY of the base vue-router settings here as well since 
  Nuxt is using that behind the scenes. 
    - This is basically the vue-router route config with added Nuxt features
    - You can mess with: linkActiveClass, scrollBehavior, etc. 
- EXAMPLE: 
    /*
        base 
            - This property is used to set the baseUrl upon which 
              your app's pages are served. 
        extendRoutes(routes, resolve)
            - Nuxt already supplies routes for you based on the directory 
              structure of the project 
            - This function allows you to add custom routes to the 
              routes already supplied by Nuxt. 
            - the <routes> param is the routes provided by Nuxt. 
                - You can push normal vue-router route objects onto this 
                  array. 
    */
    router: {
        base: '/my-app/',
        extendRoutes(routes, resolve) {
            routes.push({
                path: '*', 
                component: resolve(__dirname + 'pages/index.vue')'
            });
        }
    }


-------------------
ANIMATING PAGE TRANSITIONS   
-------------------
config.srcDir
- Set the source directory of the Nuxt files 
    - "where are all the source code folders for the Nuxt project" 
    - This is like rootDir except that it doesn't require node_modules
- Nuxt will expect folders like assets/, components/,  pages/, etc. to all 
  be inside of the specified srcDir
    - Meanwhile config files and node_modules are in the rootDir
    EXAMPLE: srcDir: 'client-app/'

config.transition
- Useful for setting animations during route changes 
- Values: 
    - If you pass this a string it will look for CSS classes with the name 
      of the string passed. 
    - If you pass an object you can set sub-attributes of the transition as 
      well as the name of the transition classes.  

EXAMPLE STRING: 
    transition: 'page'

EXAMPLE OBJECT: 
    transition: {
        // sets the CSS classes to be .page-enter, .page-leave-to, etc. 
        name: 'page', 
        // makes the page fade out first and the new one come in. 
        mode: 'out-in' 
    }


-------------------
ADDING PLUGINS    
-------------------
config.plugins 
- Allows you to load functionality BEFORE the app is fully mounted and rendered
- You can execute certain code before the app is mounted 
    - This is important since we don't have access to the main.js file 
      which is part of normal Vue apps. 
- USE CASE: Set up component library as 'globally' registered components 
  so we don't have to import them all over the place. 
    1) Set up a <plugin>.js file in the ~plugins/ directory 
    2) Import all of the components into the <plugin>.js file
    3) Import Vue from 'vue'
    4) We can now call Vue.component('<nameOfComponent>', componentObject)
        - Do this for each component 
    5) add the plugin file in the config file 
        plugins: [
            '~plugins/<plugin>.js'
        ]
    6) Now that its added here it adds the plugin to the Nuxt mounting/build 
       process. In this particular use case it means we don't have to register 
       the components locally. 


-------------------
REGISTERING A DATE FILTER 
-------------------
- PREFACE: 
    - Using plugins as a means to register vue-related plugins and packages is fine 
    - However, since it allows you to run code before the root Vue object is instantiated 
      you can do many other things. (Polyfills, 3rd party lib injection, etc.)
    - ANY GLOBAL CODE you want to run before application start-up you can CREATE A PLUGIN FOR IT. 

- REGISTERING A VUE FILTER:
